# CS Challenges

This repository will contain challenges for basic computer science knowledge like data structures and algorithms.

## Getting Started
* This repository is written in `Python` so you would need to install `python 2.7` on your machine if you do not have it already
* Make sure to have python's package manager `pip` installed. Instructions [Here!](http://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing/#install-pip-setuptools-and-wheel)
* Install the `virtualenv` [package](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and the `virtualenvwrapper` [extension](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)
* Create and activate a virtualenv
* Clone this repository
* Go to the `sorting_challenge` directory
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run `nosetests` to run the tests
* You're ready to go! All you have to do now is make the tests pass

####Contribution Guidelines:
1. Fork it: [Fork CS Challenges on Github](https://github.com/andela/cs_challenges/fork)

3. Write tests and make sure they cover the cases for the problems
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some challenge'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-challenge`)

#### Note:
```
We would be extending this repo to include other challenges so the file/tests structure will change over time.
